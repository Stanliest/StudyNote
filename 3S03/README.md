## slide 1 test principles
### Principles
1. a necessary part of a test case is a definition of the expected output or result.  
2. a programmer shoud avoid attempting to test his or her own program.  
3. a programming organization should not test its own programs.
4. thoroughly inspect the results of each test.
5. test cases must be written for input conditions that are invalid and unexpected, as well as for valid and expected.
6. avoid throwaway test cases unless the program is truly a throwaway program.
7. do not plan a testing effort under the tacit assumption that no errors will be found.
8. prob of existence of more errors in a section of program is proportional to the # of errors already found in that section.
9. testing is an extremely creative and intelectually challenging task. (i know)
10. no 10

Testing is the process of executing a program with the intent of finding errors.
